        <h2>Dream-House,</h2>
        <p className="text-[17px] text-justifiy">
        In my dream, I find myself standing before an elegant apartment house, its facade adorned with intricate details that speak of a rich history. As I step inside, I'm greeted by a grand foyer with marble floors and a sweeping staircase leading to the upper floors. Each apartment is a sanctuary of comfort and style, with spacious rooms filled with natural light streaming through large windows. The atmosphere hums with a sense of community, as neighbors greet each other warmly in shared spaces like rooftop gardens and cozy lounges. It's a place where dreams find a home, and where every corner holds the promise of possibility.
